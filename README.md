# X-Twitter AI Automation ü§ñ üöÄ

A powerful Node.js application that automates the process of capturing tweets from specified Twitter/X accounts, processing them with OpenAI to extract relevant news, and reposting them to your Twitter account. All of this is accomplished without requiring a Twitter API key - just your regular Twitter credentials.

## üìã Prerequisites

Here's what you need to get started:

- **Node.js 18 or higher**
  
  Node.js is the platform that powers this application. To check if you have it installed, open your terminal and type:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
  
  If you see a version number (like v18.x.x), you're set. If not, install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Twitter/X Account**
  - You only need a standard Twitter/X account (free)
  - **NO Twitter Developer Account or API keys needed**
  - Have your Twitter username, password, and email ready for login

- **OpenAI API Key**
  - Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
  - Navigate to the API section and create a new API key
  - Make sure you have credits available on your OpenAI account

- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ammar199503/X-Twitter-AI-Automation.git
   cd X-Twitter-AI-Automation
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   This comprehensive setup script installs all required packages for the frontend, backend, and root project.

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter any errors during the installation process, try these steps:

1. **Missing modules error:**
   ```bash
   # Remove node_modules and package-lock.json files
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   rm -rf backend/node_modules backend/package-lock.json
   rm -rf frontend/node_modules frontend/package-lock.json
   
   # Clean npm cache
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # Reinstall all dependencies
   npm install
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Node version issues:**
   - Verify your Node.js version (this project requires Node.js 18 or higher):
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   - If your Node version is below 18, update it

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Start the complete application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This launches both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

2. **Or run components individually**:
   ```bash
   # Backend only
   npm run backend
   
   # Frontend only
   npm run frontend
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend interface: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3002

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of two main components:

### Backend (Node.js)
- **REST API**: Handles all Twitter interactions and OpenAI processing
- **Twitter Integration**: Uses agent-twitter-client for browser-based Twitter interaction
- **OpenAI Integration**: Processes tweets to extract relevant information
- **Configuration Management**: Stores and manages application settings
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Frontend (React)
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of scraper status
- **Configuration Pages**: Easy setup of target accounts and system settings
- **User-friendly Interface**: Modern, responsive design built with Material UI
- **Authentication**: Secure Twitter login management

## üí° Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### Initial Setup

1. Start the application with `npm run dev`
2. Access http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Log in with your Twitter credentials (these are used locally and not stored remotely)

### Target Account Configuration

1. After login, add Twitter accounts to monitor (e.g., @elonmusk, @vitalikbuterin)
2. Optionally specify pinned tweet IDs to skip during scraping
3. Save your configuration before proceeding

### Application Settings

1. **Scraper Settings**: Configure delays between posts and tweets per account
2. **OpenAI Configuration**: Set up your API key, model, and customize tweet processing parameters
3. **Dashboard**: Monitor status, view logs, and control the scraping process

### Authentication & Bot Protection

The application includes robust handling for Twitter authentication and bot detection:

- Human-like behavior patterns with randomized delays
- Intelligent error handling for verification challenges
- Automatic cookie management for better session persistence
- Clear guidance when authentication issues occur

### Best Practices

- Include a diverse mix of sources (news sites, industry leaders, analysts)
- Set reasonable delays between posts (5-15 minutes recommended)
- Use modern OpenAI models (like gpt-4o) for better understanding of content
- Monitor your posts regularly to ensure quality and relevance
- Avoid including too many target accounts to prevent rate limiting
- Customize your prompts based on your specific use case (examples are provided in the UI)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration
- **Target Accounts**: List of Twitter accounts to monitor
- **Pinned Tweet IDs**: Tweet IDs to skip during scraping
- **Delay Settings**: Minimum and maximum delay between posts (in seconds)
- **Tweets Per Account**: Number of tweets to fetch from each target account

### OpenAI Configuration
- **Model Selection**: Choose from models like gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo, and others
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (lower values = more deterministic outputs)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum length of generated responses
- **System Prompt**: Guidelines for how the AI should process tweets
- **User Prompt Template**: Format for how tweets are presented to the AI

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Verify your Twitter credentials and internet connection
- **Login Problems**: Make sure you're using the email associated with your Twitter account
- **Scraping Not Starting**: Check that target accounts are configured and OpenAI API key is valid
- **No Tweets Being Posted**: If no relevant content is found, try adjusting your system prompt to be more inclusive
- **Rate Limiting**: Twitter may limit requests if you make too many in a short time; increase delay between cycles
- **Backend Not Starting**: Verify port 3002 is available and not in use by another application
- **OpenAI Errors**: Confirm your API key is valid and you have sufficient credits
- **Authentication Problems**: Follow the guidance on the Dashboard for re-authentication
